When complete, paste a screenshot of your terminal or command prompt that shows.

Video Steps:
Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed. 
This video should be done using screen share and voice over. 
This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend. 
You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording. 
This will create a video recording on your computer. 
This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. 
Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
